            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p>I am a person focused individual who has the ability to learn new skills and adapt to any challenge. I am looking for employment in a junior front end developer role within a company that can offer progression within. I have recently completed a 12 week full time course with Recode and during this course we learned html, CSS and some JavaScript. I have always been into computers, I was able to strip a pc down and upgrade new parts and fix the basics, I also can install software and such alike. I have always wanted to know how to code but never knew where to start, but now I have the basic skills I want to expand my knowledge and know how.
